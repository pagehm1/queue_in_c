# queue_in_c

A base implementation of a queue in C. 


## How to Use

1. Download the files through or clone the repository, then extract and place the files where they will be used.
2. In the file that the queue is going to be implemented, place the following at the top of the program: `#include "queue.h"`
3. Have the .c file named when adding the program, i.e. `gcc test.c queue.c -o test`

## How to Run the Test File
1. Download or clone the repo.
2. If using a linux-based command line, use: `gcc test.c queue.c -o test`. *test can be named anything*
3. Then, run the binary that was built after compiling.
